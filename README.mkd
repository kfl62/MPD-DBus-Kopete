#  Kopete NowPlaying MPD
Once, long ago, [Kopete] had support for [MPD], but as it'seen, not anymore [(until when it is not known)][1] quite frustrating but...

[Kopete] is connected to dbus, so the problem is reduced to sending the information to the right address in dbus, unfortunately, as it is in the [discussion], [MPD] has no (and will not have any) support for dbus.

In conclusion, in order to share with your friends what you are listening too, a communication interface is required for [MPD] with Kopete's dbus.<br>
After a long session in the Google search (my friend), I found some articles (see Resources) and I wrote MPD-DBus-Kopete.

**Requirements**

1. Ruby 1.9 mostly for encoding issues (Tested on 1.9.2.p0);
2. Ruby D-Bus ( I use [most active fork][2] from GitHub);

        git clone git://github.com/mvidner/ruby-dbus.git
        cd ruby-dbus
        rake gem
        rvm gem install|gem install|sudo gem install pkg/ruby-dbus-version.gem

*Note: Embedded libraries*<br>
1. librmpd2 library which handles [MPD] related stuff, comes from [Jeffrey Aylesworth's rMPD][3], without any modifications;<br>
2. simple-daemon library, is borrowed from [Bryan Liles's simple-daemon][4], slightly modified to suit specific needs;<br>
So all merits are theirs :).

**Install**
