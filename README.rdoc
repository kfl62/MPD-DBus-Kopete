==  Kopete NowPaying MPD

Once, long ago, {Kopete}[http://kopete.kde.org/] has support for {MPD}[http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon_Wiki], but only has {(until it is not known)}[https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139563] but quite frustrating ...

{Kopete}[http://kopete.kde.org/] is connected to dbus, so the problem reduces to send the information to the right address in dbus, but unfortunately, as in the {discussion}[http://www.musicpd.org/forum/index.php?action=printpage;topic=570.0], {MPD}[http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon_Wiki] has no (and will not have one) support for dbus.

In conclusion, in order to share with your friends what are you listening, requires dbus support for {MPD}[http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon_Wiki] and a communication interface with Kopete's dbus.

After a long session in the Google search (my friend), I found some articles (see Resources) and I wrote MPD-DBus-Kopete
