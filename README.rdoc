==  Kopete NowPaying MPD

Once, long ago, {Kopete}[http://kopete.kde.org/] has support for {MPD}[http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon_Wiki], but only has {(until it is not known)}[https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139563] but quite frustrating ...

{Kopete}[http://kopete.kde.org/] is connected to dbus, so the problem reduces to send the information to the right address in dbus, but unfortunately, as in the {discussion}[http://www.musicpd.org/forum/index.php?action=printpage;topic=570.0], {MPD}[http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon_Wiki] has no (and will not have) support for dbus.

In conclusion, in order to share with your friends what are you listening, requires dbus support for {MPD}[http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon_Wiki] and a communication interface with Kopete's dbus.

After a long session in the Google search (my friend), I found some articles (see Resources) and I start to write MPD-DBus-Kopete

== Requirements

* Ruby 1.8 (>= 1.8.7)
* Ruby D-Bus ({most active fork}[http://github.com/mvidner/ruby-dbus]
* libmpd for Ruby (use {this}[http://github.com/jeffayle/librmpd2/], it's actualized and with callbacks

==  Helpful resources:
1. {D-Bus tutorial}[http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-tutorial.html]
2. {Ruby D-Bus tutorial}[http://trac.luon.net/data/ruby-dbus/tutorial/index.html]
3. Of course the {github}[http://github.com/search?type=Everything&language=rb&q=dbus&repo=&langOverride=&x=21&y=16&start_value=1]
