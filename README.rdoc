==  Kopete NowPlaying MPD

Once, long ago, {Kopete}[http://kopete.kde.org/] had support for {MPD}[http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon_Wiki], but as it'seen, not anymore {(until when it is not known)}[https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139563] quite frustrating but...

{Kopete}[http://kopete.kde.org/] is connected to dbus, so the problem is reduced to sending the information to the right address in dbus, unfortunately, as it is in the {discussion}[http://www.musicpd.org/forum/index.php?action=printpage;topic=570.0], {MPD}[http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon_Wiki] has no (and will not have any) support for dbus.

In conclusion, in order to share with your friends what you are listening too, a communication interface is required for {MPD}[http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon_Wiki] with Kopete's dbus.

After a long session in the Google search (my friend), I found some articles (see Resources) and I wrote MPD-DBus-Kopete

== Requirements

* Ruby 1.9.2 
* Ruby D-Bus ( {most active fork}[http://github.com/mvidner/ruby-dbus] )
* libmpd for Ruby ( use {this}[http://github.com/jeffayle/librmpd2/], it's actualized and with callbacks )

==  Helpful resources:
1. {D-Bus tutorial}[http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-tutorial.html]
2. {Ruby D-Bus tutorial}[http://trac.luon.net/data/ruby-dbus/tutorial/index.html]
3. Of course the {github}[http://github.com/search?type=Everything&language=rb&q=dbus&repo=&langOverride=&x=21&y=16&start_value=1]
